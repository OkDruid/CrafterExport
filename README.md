## CrafterExport

Simple addon for WoW WotLK Classic that allows you to export a list of recipe names in a comma delimited format. Just open a profession window and click the 'Show: CrafterExport' button then copy the text from the window. Recipes learned from a trainer are excluded as anyone can make them.
