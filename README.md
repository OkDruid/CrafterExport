## CrafterExport

Simple addon for WoW WotLK Classic that allows you to export a list of recipe names in a comma delimited format. 
Just open a profession window and click the 'Open CrafterExport' button then copy the text from the window. 
Recipes learned from a trainer are excluded as anyone can make them.

Note: To export all recipes make sure you expand all category filters in the profession window.
