## CrafterExport

Simple addon for WoW WotLK Classic that allows you to export a list of recipe names in a comma delimited format. Just open a profession window and click the 'Open CrafterExport' button then copy the text from the window. Recipes learned from a trainer are excluded as anyone can make them.

Note: The export is filtered by collapsing recipe categories and search input - to export all recipes make sure you expand all categories.
